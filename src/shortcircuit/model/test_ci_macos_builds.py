# test_ci_macos_builds.py
"""Regression tests for the macOS CI and build contract.

The packaging decisions from the PySide2 -> PySide6 migration live in CI
configuration and a shell script, not in Python, so these tests lock the
observable contract of those artefacts rather than unit-testing logic:

  * the macOS matrix builds both slices of PySide6's universal2 wheel -- arm64
    on the ``macos-15`` runner, x86_64 on ``macos-15-intel`` -- and the two
    uploads are named apart so neither clobbers the other;
  * the per-mapper ``macholib`` install step is gone (PyInstaller carries it
    itself on darwin);
  * the workflow tracks the Pipfile's Python 3.13 and does not force an x64
    interpreter, so the arm64 runner gets arm64 Python;
  * ``build_mac_installer.sh`` takes the target architecture and hands it to
    PyInstaller as ``--target-arch``, and the dead ``shortcircuit.spec`` is
    gone;
  * ``Pipfile.lock`` stays cross-platform, carrying the Windows-only deps that
    a single-platform ``pipenv lock`` would drop and the Windows CI leg needs.

They live beside the model tests, per the repo convention that tests are
collocated with the code they cover rather than in a top-level ``tests/``
directory. They exercise build/CI configuration, which already lives at the
repo root, so they read those artefacts relative to the repo root.
